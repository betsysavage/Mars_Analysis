## Deliverable 2: Analysis of Mars Weather Data

1. How many months exist on Mars?


2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?


3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.

4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.


5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
